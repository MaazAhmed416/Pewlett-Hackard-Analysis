# Employees retiring per title and employees eligible to participate in mentorship program

## Purpose of Project
The purpose of our project was to determine the total number of employees who fall in the retirement-age at Pewlett Hackard for the many different designations of the corporation. Furthermore, we found the unique count of the total number of employees for the different designations who fall in the retirement-age. Additionally, we found the number of employees in different departments who have been with the company since 1965 who are retirement-ready and eligible for the mentorship program

## Results of the Analysis

### Retiring employees title
- Our analysis gave a clear break down of who and from what department is about to retire
- The number of senior managers who will retire is very high. Also, we found that the requirement for number of senior staff and engineers is also very high 
- We also know that only two managers will be retiring soon

### Mentorship eligibility 
- From our analysis we found the name and positions (title) of individuals who have been with the company since 1965 who are eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary of our analysis
- The number of roles that need to be filled as people start retiring is quite high. We know that soon the company would need to hire 29,414 Senior Engineers, 28254 Senior Staff, 14222 Engineer, 12243 Staff, 4502 Technique Leader, 1761 Assistant Enginners and 2 Managers
- Based on analysis, there are only 1,549 employees that are retirement-ready who meet the criteria of being eligible for the mentorship program. The next generation that will require mentoring is quite higher than the retirement-ready employees qualified to mentor them
- A table that will further provide insight of our analysis could be for the retirement-ready employees qualified to mentor the new generation. A table which gives the total number of such employees in different departments will be beneficial for the human resources team to strategize for the future
- Another table that will be helpful could be for the number of employees that were born between 1966 and 1970 who are still working for the organization. These employees also have extensive experince with the company and are also great assets for the organization. Pewlett Hackard should consider such employees for the mentorship program and offer perks for them to take part in the program.
